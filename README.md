# Unity-CameraController
This is a camera controller that can be use for RTS games made in Unity.
It's far from perfect but it does the job pretty well and fast.


Part of this code is similar to the one found in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_adEYoaArc4 because that's where I got some ideas for the camera controller.
